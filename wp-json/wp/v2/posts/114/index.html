But it\u2019s a fear we have to face at some point if we ever want to make an impact on the world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019d love to share how I work with this fear \u2014 I\u2019ve been doing it for decades now!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The brief summary:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>I have a litmus test: if I\u2019m not creating or putting the creation out into the world, there\u2019s a good chance I\u2019m procrastinating. (There are exceptions of course.)<\/li><li>If I\u2019m avoiding, then I create space to face the fear and create and put it out there.<\/li><li>Then I face it. And play with it. And learn to relish it!<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ll dive more into this below \u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wrdpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/hu-chen-60XLoOgwkfA-unsplash-1024x770.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-138\" width=\"963\" height=\"724\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wrdpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/hu-chen-60XLoOgwkfA-unsplash-1024x770.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/localhost\/wrdpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/hu-chen-60XLoOgwkfA-unsplash-300x225.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost\/wrdpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/hu-chen-60XLoOgwkfA-unsplash-768x577.jpg 768w, http:\/\/localhost\/wrdpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/hu-chen-60XLoOgwkfA-unsplash-1536x1154.jpg 1536w, http:\/\/localhost\/wrdpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/hu-chen-60XLoOgwkfA-unsplash-2048x1539.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 963px) 100vw, 963px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>The Core of Our Fear<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What\u2019s so scary about putting our work out into the world? Well, we don\u2019t know how it will be received by other people \u2014 it\u2019s full of uncertainty, and we don\u2019t like that uncertainty.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They might judge us, dismiss it as having no value, think we\u2019re stupid. We\u2019ll feel embarrassed or rejected. This uncertainty is too much to bear for many people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And yet, as understandable as that is, this fear will shut down the possibility of having an impact on the world. Let\u2019s let our hearts be broken by that shut down possibility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And let\u2019s connect to the impact we\u2019d like to make \u2014 would we like to move people\u2019s hearts, change people\u2019s lives, open their eyes to something new? How delicious!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Facing the Avoidance<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to face our fear and what we\u2019re avoiding \u2026 we have to know we\u2019re avoiding. So the first thing I do is ask myself, \u201cAm I creating right now, or putting my work out into the world?\u201d If not, there\u2019s a decent chance I\u2019m avoiding out of fear.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are seeming exceptions of course: collaborating with others in team meetings (I would argue that\u2019s creating), coaching (that\u2019s both creating and putting my work out there), research (but keep it to a bare minimum, most people procrastinate by researching more than is needed). We have to do admin work and emails too \u2014 but if I haven\u2019t created today, then I know I let my day get filled with administrative busywork instead of focusing on the thing that matters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So once we see we\u2019re avoiding creating and putting it out there \u2026 it helps to create structure to face the fear.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re avoiding creating: set up a daily session to feel the fear and then create. Not research, but actually create. Do it on a video call with others, if that helps, or get an accountability group.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re creating but avoiding putting it out there: commit to doing it in small steps. For example, send it to a group of people you trust. When that gets easy, send it to a larger group. Then put it into other communities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Work on the muscle of creating, and putting it out there regularly. Every day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Join me in my&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/fearless.zenhabits.net\/\">Fearless Training Program<\/a>&nbsp;if that\u2019s the kind of training you\u2019d like to do.
